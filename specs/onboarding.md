# Onboarding

## Working on single feature/problem/task
1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/cse110-sp21-group22/cse110-sp21-group22.git)
2. Create a new issue for your task.
3. Every time you create a new issue, there will be a new branch automatically created for that issue.
4. Your current working progress should be push to that branch first.
5. After that, create a pull request to merge to 'main'.
6. The pull request will need to be reviewed in order to be merged to 'main'.

Remember to pull from main branch!
