## Settings
~~## Do we need to turn off daily quote and rose&thorn?~~
~~## Should we add light/dark mode? Might not need because theme/background color change~~  
Front-end:
- Font: only for object that user can edit: daily log
- Background & theme: how to make them work on all pages.
- Theme color applies to: Nav bar words & icon, progress bar, daily log: button. Question: can you change icon color? If not, we need to rethink about the theme color: what would it apply?
- Background color applies to: color of nav bar, background of all pages
## Mood Tracker
Look into more API that apply the mood tracker & CodePen might have good visual examples.
