## Progress
- Skeleton of Pages
  - Creation of all pages
  - Functional navigation bar across all pages
  - Page layout: responsive
- Progress Bar
  - Most is completed, except the the running man is not following the bar.
- Quote Generator
  - Completed, pulls random quotes from alternate website
  - Pending integration with codebase
- Sticky note feature
- Mood Tracker
  - Year's grid set up to populate according to each month's days (including if current year is leap year)
  - Mood icons set up: when a mood is clicked, the current day's box is filled
  - Each day's box color is saved in local storage for now
  - Year's grid is cleared when it is a new year, but need to fix issue with saving the box color of the first day of the year
  - Needs to save which icon was selected for the current day if page refreshed
  - Needs to be styled and made pretty still
- User Authentication
  - User signup and login with firebase backend works
  - Create storage for user on signup works
- Calendar
  - Needs to be tied to daily log, upcoming tasks
  - Have tags for entries based on due date, main entry vs nested information

## Feedback
- Progress Bar: need to match the running icons, flaming pages for final week is a plus.
- Page layout: alligning the line and words accordingly; add black board background
- Quote generator: put in its position on the page
- Mood Tracker: fix issue with saving the box color of the first day of the year; local memory for icons selected within the day

Next meeting will be at Sunday 10pm.
