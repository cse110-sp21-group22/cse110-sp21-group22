Technical Story: Need a log-in service to retain data.

## Context and Problem Statement
We want some of our data to be persistent between users and allow them to be able to log in from multiple devices, so we need a log-in portal to identify users.

## Decision Drivers

* User privacy & data storage

## Considered Options

1. Allowing user to login/create an account
2. No login and unable to save data to account

## Decision Outcome

We chose option 1 because we allow our users to store their settings, preferences and data.

### Positive Consequences

* Users can now sign in with multiple devices and have their journal information with their data preserved.
* Easy to set up authentification

### Negative Consequences

* Extra work and testing to make sure correct storage.
* May be concerns over user privacy
  * concerns over how data is stored and managed
