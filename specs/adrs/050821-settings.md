Technical Story: Introduction of a Settings Page

## Context and Problem Statement

We want the website to focus on our audience of high-school and university students. As such, we want to add a couple customizable features in order to allow the user to express their school spirit.

## Decision Drivers

* Customizability

## Considered Options

1. Allowing user to turn off and on daily quote.
2. Font customization
3. Creating a separate page for the settings.
4. Change the color theme of the website

## Decision Outcome

We chose option 2 and 4 because we allow our users to customize their font and color theme. We chose option 3 because we want to keep the settings organize and not clutter up our home page.  


### Positive Consequences

* Lots of extra space with a new page, allows for newer settings to easily be implemented in the future.
* Less features to consider

### Negative Consequences

* User needs to access a new page to change settings as opposed to just opening a side panel.
