Technical Story: Calendar page functionality

## Context and Problem Statement

We didn't like the way that we originally set up this page, so we want to make changes to have it be more functional and user friendly.

## Decision Drivers

* Usability

## Considered Options

1. Progress bar based on academic start date and end date
2. Keep the left side bar as is.
3. The right side panel display info of a specific date when you click on that date in the left panel.

## Decision Outcome

We choose options 1, 2. The progress bar is one of the features to help our target users (students) keep track of their academic term that we see non other team has. The left side bar is a basic feature of bullet journal that we can utilize to show a bird eye view of the future plan.
We haven't figured out what specific kind of information should be displayed in this right panel (task? nested task? if so, what's the difference between this and the daily log?).

### Positive Consequences

* Allows the user to view their current progress in their acedemic year.
* Allows us to add more features in the future

### Negative Consequences

* Lot of empty space on the page that could be utilized more effectively!
* User can't have a quick overview about important day for next month.
