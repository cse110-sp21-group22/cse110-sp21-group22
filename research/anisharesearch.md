# Bullet Journal Research

## History
- created by Ryder Carroll
- he was diagnosed with learning diabilities (attention deficit) early in life
- he was forced to figure out alternate ways to be focused and productive
- through years of trial and error, he developed a methodology that went far beyond simple organization

## What
- mindfulness practice disguised as a producitivity system
- helps you organize WHAT while you remain mindful of your WHY
- goal: help its practitioners live intentional lives (both productive and meaningful)

## How
### Rapid Logging
- bullets: tasks (dot), events (open circle), notes (dash)
- signifiers: * (priority), ! (inspiration), etc.
- page: topic (descriptive, clarify purpose), number page (serve to locate content)
### Collections
- index: front of notebook, topics and page numbers
- future log: outside of current month, can be 6 month template, serves as time machine, each month review future log and migrate into month log
- monthly log: spread of facing pages with calendar and task page, calendar (birdseye view of month, schedule events and tasks, record events after happen, entries as short as possible because for reference only), task (monthly mental inventory, priorities for month, undone from last month, what matters now), leave room in left to add signifiers
- daily log: day-to-day use, date as topic at top of page, rapid log tasks + events + notes as they occur, add next day where left off if didn't fill whole page, create them as you go (never know how much space needed for day)
- custom log: become whatever you need it to be, design own collection (fitness, fertility, food, diary, sketchbook, etc.), how you're spening time and energy
### Migration
- helps us be productive by weeding out distractions
- at end of month, set up new monthly log
- review pages of past month and figure out which incomplete tasks are worth your limited time and energy moving forward (strike out those that aren't, and migrate the ones that are)
- turn the task's dot into ">" to indicate you've moved that task forward into the new month log or appropriate collection
- check future log and see if any tasks or events have become current (migrate those entries from future into new month log)
- this process makes you pause and consider each item
- surface what's worth the effort, become aware of our actions, and to separate the signal from the noise

## Problems to Solve
- declutter your mind
- cultivate your curiosity
- remaining focused
- leading a distracted life to leading one with intention
- how to invest your energy and time
- decision fatigue

## Addressing the Problems
- mental inventory: things need to do, should do, and want to do
- for each inventory item: is it vital? does it matter? (cross off list if no because it is distraction)
- take goals and break down into small actionable projects: no barriers, clearly defined tasks, less than a month
- indulge in curiosity and try it and see if it fits so you don't waste time
- update your map (and goals as time passes)
- reflect, ideate, and dedicate
