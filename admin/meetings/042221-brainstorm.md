## Group discussion
Represent our research about BuJo.

Jenny: likes the signifiers (* and !)

Ajay: looks into pros/cons between paper vs. digital
- Paper: personal, customizable
- Digital: easy to organize & access

Anisha: notices the ability to constantly declutter/get rid off things when using BuJo

Robert: provides lots of features (light/dark, media)

Shanqing: thinks of BuJo as a bird-eye view of tasks. Focus on the 'Migration' function of BuJo

Nguyen: focuses on the daily function of BuJo: reminders
